# LPHW
Learn python programming follow the book [LPHW](http://www.2cto.com/shouce/Pythonbbf/ex11.html)     
Until Now, Basic Practice had been finished.
In the following days, I will learn how to create an
project, debug my program and test the result of my program.
stick on my goal, one day will come.
please follow me if you think this will benifit you.    

### Create One Project Skeleton      

	mkdir -p projects    
	cd projects/    
	mkdir skeleton        
	cd skeleton    
	mkdir bin NAME tests docs    

### Initial configure file

	touch NAME/__init__.py    
	touch tests/__init__.py    
	touch setup.py    

### Create test file    

	touch tests/NAME_tests.py

### Install Some Packages    
pip – http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip    
distribute – http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute    
nose – http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/    
virtualenv – http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv    

# Every Project You Can Do as the following steps

1. Copy this skeleton and change the name of project to your new file
2. Change the name of NAME to project or anything you like
3. Including the information of your new project by editting setup.py file
4. To match you new module, you should rename tests/NAME_tests.py file
5. Checking the problem with nosetests
6. Coding now.

*more and more practices make me stronger than before*
I End this Practice and Try to do more programming excercise
